                <h2>Welcome to the party</h2>
                <p>As a young industry with diverse roles, it’s hard to find two people with matching journeys to their professional gig. Even age is no clear indicator of in-field experience, as jumping into the web business has become a popular mid-career switch. And while generalists are still in need, growth and increased complexity have continued to create new roles for specialization.<br>
                    Our field is growing, outpacing projected nationwide growth in new jobs with an <em>estimated 15% increase in web development jobs over 10 years.</em> If you’ve just started exploring the industry, you’re not too late; we’re just getting started.

                <h2>You don’t need a college degree</h2>
                <p>Don’t take my word for it. Even tech heavyweights like Google, Apple, and IBM no longer require employees to have a degree. Many smaller software companies have been this way for years: they care more about the skills you have than where you learned them. It’s an increasingly large talent pool: 24% of professional developers who took Stack Overflow’s 2018 survey said that they don’t have a college degree.</p>
                <p>Colleges have long struggled to teach up-to-date practices in web design and development. Their curriculum approval process simply can’t keep up with the rate of change. If you’re researching a program to attend, the best focus on technology-independent principles, but use current and upcoming approaches to teach it.</p>
