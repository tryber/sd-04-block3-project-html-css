                <h2>Welcome to the party</h2>
                <p>As a young industry with diverse roles, it’s hard to find two people with matching journeys to their professional gig. Even age is no clear indicator of in-field experience, as jumping into the web business has become a popular mid-career switch. And while generalists are still in need, growth and increased complexity have continued to create new roles for specialization.<br>
                    Our field is growing, outpacing projected nationwide growth in new jobs with an <em>estimated 15% increase in web development jobs over 10 years.</em> If you’ve just started exploring the industry, you’re not too late; we’re just getting started.

                <h2>You don’t need a college degree</h2>
                <p>Don’t take my word for it. Even tech heavyweights like Google, Apple, and IBM no longer require employees to have a degree. Many smaller software companies have been this way for years: they care more about the skills you have than where you learned them. It’s an increasingly large talent pool: 24% of professional developers who took Stack Overflow’s 2018 survey said that they don’t have a college degree.</p>
                <p>Colleges have long struggled to teach up-to-date practices in web design and development. Their curriculum approval process simply can’t keep up with the rate of change. If you’re researching a program to attend, the best focus on technology-independent principles, but use current and upcoming approaches to teach it.</p>
                <p class="lado-esquerdo">Ours is probably the most open industry in terms of the number and availability of learning options. There are countless quality learning platforms to learn coding and design that are either free or radically cheaper than a “formal” education. For me, studying Computer Science was interesting and helpful, but these learning sites are where I really learned the fundamentals and practical skills for web development.</p>

                <h2>Build experience by…building things</h2>
                <p>There’s a lot of learning that comes only through doing, which is convenient because building experience through real-world projects turns out to be pretty necessary. You can’t waltz in to a job interview claiming to know X, Y, and Z without the work to show it. Just knowing the fundamentals doesn’t cut it — so what does?</p>
                <p>As Chris Coyier of CSS-Tricks famously says: “Just build websites.” There really is no better way to get good at web design/development. Building something real gives you the opportunity to put what you’ve learned to use, pick up new concepts, and seek out creative solutions on the fly.</p>
                <p>Don’t know what to build? Take a look at your passions and interests — there’s bound to be a few crappy websites in that area that could use a redesign. Some groups are notorious for having bad websites. Find a niche that’s neglected and get building! Here are some ideas:</p>
